# Kardashev Scale

The Kardashev Scale measures a civilization's technological advancement by the amount of energy it can harness. Nikolai Kardashev proposed the scale in 1964 with three categories:

# Type I Civilization

A planetary civilization that can harness and store all of the energy available on its home planet.

# Type II Civilization

A stellar civilization that can harness the total energy of its star (e.g. capturing the Sun's output with a Dyson Sphere).

# Type III Civilization

A galactic civilization that can control energy on the scale of its entire galaxy.

# Carl Sagan's Refinement

Carl Sagan introduced a formula-based interpolation of the original Kardashev types. Instead of the large jumps between types, energy consumption grows more continuously. Conveniently, each 0.1 step on the scale corresponds to a tenfold increase in energy usage. Under this formula, Earth's civilization rates at approximately 0.7, meaning we are partway toward Type I but not there yet. The intermediate values allow for more precise comparisons between civilizations that would otherwise all fall into the same broad category.

# Extension

Other theorists have extended the scale to include higher levels of energy manipulation, but the original three types remain the most widely discussed.
