# Number of Planets

The number of planets a civilization controls is a simple measure of territorial reach and resource access. More planets generally means more raw materials, more population capacity, and more strategic depth against catastrophic events.

That said, the metric has obvious limitations:

1. Variability in inhabitants: A civilization might control many planets but have tiny populations on each. Raw planet count does not reflect actual demographic weight.
2. Diverse planetary conditions: Not all planets are equal. Some are resource-rich, others are barren outposts. The count says nothing about individual value.
3. Alternative celestial bodies: Depending on the universe, moons, asteroids, or artificial habitats may matter more than planets.
4. Universe properties: Some settings feature inter-dimensional realms, megastructures, or virtual spaces that make planet counting less meaningful.
