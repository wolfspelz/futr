  # Concept

  Techlevel measures the difficulty and sophistication of a civilization's most advanced
  individual technology. Complements Class (overall capability including reach) and
  Kardashev Rating (energy use).

  **Key principle:** Only the hardest-to-invent and/or most advanced technology matters, 
  not the scale or reach or quantity of a civilization.
  - A single lab with a fusion reactor rates the same as a civilization with thousands of planets with thousands of 
  fusion reactors each. 
  - A Matrioshka brain built from fusion-powered processors is TL 7
  (Fusion), not higher, unless it uses it's brain power to create exotic substrates like magmatter (TL 11) for orbitals and ringworlds
  A Dyson sphere is just solar panels at scale (TL 7), not a separate tech level.

  Magic, psionics, and other non-technological capabilities are rated by the equivalent
  technological effect they achieve (e.g. psionic teleportation = TL 10).
