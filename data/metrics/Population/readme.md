# Total Population

Total population is a direct measure of a civilization's size and workforce. A larger population generally means more economic output, more cultural diversity, and more redundancy if one region is lost.

There are limitations to consider:

1. Resource management: A large population requires proportionally more resources. Overpopulation can strain ecosystems and trigger conflicts.
2. Cultural and social dynamics: A vast population spread across many worlds develops divergent cultures and social structures, making governance harder.
3. Technological needs: Large interstellar populations depend on advanced transportation, communication, and governance systems to stay coherent.
4. Variable living conditions: Not all habitats are equally hospitable. Population counts alone say nothing about quality of life or the technology needed to sustain it.
