  # Description

  Class measures a civilization's overall capability: what it can build, do, and reach.
  Complements Kardashev Rating (energy) and Tech Summary (text description).
  Scale unifies GURPS TL (0-16), Orion's Arm toposophic levels (S0-S6),
  and Perry Rhodan's cosmic hierarchy.

  Note: The scale names suggest a correlation between tech grade and territorial reach,
  but these are independent axes. A single-system civilization or even an individual
  can be godlike at Class 18-19 (e.g. Q, Douwd, Lorien), while galaxy-spanning empires
  may run on relatively mundane FTL jump drives at Class 11-12 (e.g. Foundation's Galactic
  Empire, Traveller's Third Imperium). You can have pocket-universe technology without
  owning a galaxy, and own the galaxy with boring hyperdrives.
