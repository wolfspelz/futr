# FUTR Data

The top level folder of a data storage might look boring

but

it has [Metrics](metrics) - a myriad cool ways to measure universes

and [Universes](universes) - the universes we all know and love

## Contribute

The best way to contribute is to

- [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository,
- make changes,
- then make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

I understand this looks like a coder's only domain, but let's debunk some myths about GitHub:

1. It's Only for Coders: While GitHub is a platform primarily used for version control and collaboration on code, it's also a space for writers, designers, project managers, and anyone who wants to collaborate on a project. Documentation, design mockups, and even entire books have been written and collaborated on using GitHub.
1. It's Too Technical: At first glance, the terminology and workflow might seem daunting. But just like any other tool, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. There are plenty of beginner-friendly resources and tutorials available to help you get started.
1. Only Big Projects Use GitHub: From small personal projects to massive open-source initiatives, GitHub hosts a diverse range of projects. So, whether you're working on a personal blog or contributing to a global initiative, GitHub is the place to be.
1. I Can't Contribute If I Don't Code: There are many ways to contribute to a project beyond coding. This project in particular needs many peole to contribute texts, ideas, thoughts, research.
1. It's Just a Storage Space for Code: While GitHub does store code, it's much more than that. It's a platform for collaboration, discussion, and discovery. With features like issues and discussions, it's a space to communicate ideas, report bugs, and ask questions.

What we use from the GitHub Toolset without having to program or setup anything:

- Text editor (just markup, but good enough)
- Versions, version history, and rollback 
- Secure user accounts
- Editorial process (by merge request and branch based access rights)
- Discussion forum (with discussions linked to changes)
- (latr) Project management (in form of the agile board) 
- (latr) Deployment pipeline
- (latr) Static site generators integrate well with GitHub
