The Union of Allied Planets governs all settled worlds in the Verse from its twin capitals of Londinium and Sihnon. It began as a merger between the United States and the People's Republic of China during the long voyage from Earth-That-Was.

Parliament is on Londinium, a Western-influenced world. Sihnon, shaped by East Asian culture, is the Alliance's intellectual and artistic capital. A Prime Minister heads the executive branch, backed by a large bureaucracy of ministries and oversight councils.

The Alliance runs a sizable military. The Anglo-Sino Alliance Navy patrols shipping lanes and enforces federal law. Federal Marshals and the Interplanetary Police handle ground-level enforcement, though they are spread thin outside the Core.

After the Independent Planets attempted secession in 2506, the Alliance fought a five-year Unification War that ended at the Battle of Serenity Valley in 2511. Victory brought the entire Verse under Alliance control, but the outer worlds never stopped resenting it. The Alliance pours resources into the Core and leaves the Border and Rim to fend for themselves, which is how the frontier ended up full of smugglers and outlaws.
