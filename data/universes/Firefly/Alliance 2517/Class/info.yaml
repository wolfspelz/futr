  Class 8: Advanced Interplanetary. The Alliance has terraformed over 200 worlds across a multi-star cluster and maintains mature interplanetary civilization with gravity manipulation drives, but lacks FTL travel. Helioforming 7 brown dwarfs into protostars demonstrates significant stellar engineering capability, pushing the upper end of Class 8 without quite reaching Class 9 (which requires FTL).
