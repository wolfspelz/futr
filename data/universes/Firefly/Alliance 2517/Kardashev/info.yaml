  Population: 303e9. Estimated per-person power by region:
  Core (40B): ~30,000 W/person (advanced tech, terraforming maintenance).
  Border (150B): ~7,500 W/person (moderate tech).
  Rim (113B): ~2,000 W/person (frontier conditions).
  Weighted average: ~8,400 W/person (vs Earth 2023: 2,200 W/person, about 3.8x more).

  Total power: 303e9 x 8,400 = 2.55e15 W.
  Kardashev: log10(2.55e15) / 10 - 0.6 = 0.94, rounded to 0.95.

  Min (5,000 W/person): 1.5e15 W, K = 0.85.
  Max (30,000 W/person): 9.1e15 W, K = 1.05.

  TV Tropes analysis estimates 10^15 to 10^17 W based on Serenity's power output, consistent with this range. Helioforming 7 brown dwarfs suggests peak capabilities above baseline, but everyday tech (ballistic weapons, fuel-cell ships, no FTL) is modest for science fiction.
