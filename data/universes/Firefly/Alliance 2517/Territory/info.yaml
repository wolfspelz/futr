  The Verse is a compact multi-star cluster. A Class 10 pulse drive (fastest available) can cross it in about 25 days at sublight speed. Assuming speeds in the range of 0.01c to 0.1c, the cluster diameter is roughly a few hundred AU, or on the order of 0.01 light-years. The real-world astrophysical analysis at planetplanet.net shows the system would need to be fairly compact to remain gravitationally bound.
