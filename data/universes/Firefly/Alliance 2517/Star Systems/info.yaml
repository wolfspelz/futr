  The Verse contains 5 main sequence stars, each with its own planetary system: White Sun (Bai Hu, central Core), Georgia (Huang Long, Border), Red Sun (Zhu Que, Border), Kalidasa (Xuan Wu, Rim), and Blue Sun (Qing Long, outermost Rim). Additionally, 7 brown dwarfs were helioformed into protostars between 2258-2273, providing supplementary heat for outer moons. The entire cluster is gravitationally bound as a single multi-star system designated 34Tauri(2020).
