  The Alliance traces its origins to 2060, when the United States and People's Republic of China merged to form the Anglo-Sino Alliance during the exodus from Earth-That-Was. By the snapshot year of 2517, the Alliance has existed for 457 years. The 2060 founding date comes from the licensed RPG sourcebook timeline.
