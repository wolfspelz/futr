  The Verse is located at the star cluster designated 34Tauri(2020), roughly 160 light-years from Earth-That-Was. The designation comes from the Official Map of the Verse, a QMx-produced chart endorsed by the show's creators. The cluster contains 5 main sequence stars and 7 helioformed protostars in a gravitationally bound system.
