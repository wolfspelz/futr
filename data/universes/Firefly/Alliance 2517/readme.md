Six years after the Unification War, the Alliance presides over a Verse at uneasy peace. Londinium's Parliament debates policy affecting billions. Ariel has some of the best hospitals in settled space. Sihnon's training houses turn out Companions and scholars. Across more than two hundred terraformed worlds, the population has reached roughly three hundred billion.

On the outer planets, things look different. Rim worlds like Whitefall and Haven operate beyond effective Alliance control. Former Browncoats nurse grudges in frontier bars. Smugglers, petty criminals, and independent haulers keep the marginal economies running, flying under Alliance radar in aging transports and converted cargo shuttles.

The Alliance maintains order through its navy and through intelligence operations, including the classified Academy program that turns gifted children into psychic operatives. The Blue Sun Corporation, the Verse's largest conglomerate, has its fingers in both commerce and government.

More dangerous than any leftover Browncoat resistance are the Reavers, savage raiders who strike from the edges of civilized space. The Alliance publicly dismisses them as spacer myths, though military patrols along the Rim tell a different story. What actually created the Reavers on Miranda is the Alliance's best-kept secret.
