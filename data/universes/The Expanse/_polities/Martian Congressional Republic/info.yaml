  The Martian Congressional Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic governing Mars and the second of humanity's two superpowers. Founded in the early 23rd century, the MCR wins its independence from the United Nations through exclusive control of the Epstein drive, the fusion propulsion system invented by Martian colonist Solomon Epstein. In exchange for sharing this technology, Earth grants Mars full sovereignty.

  # Society

  The MCR operates as a planned economy with one overriding national project: the terraforming of Mars. Every citizen contributes directly or indirectly to this multigenerational effort to give Mars breathable air and open skies. This shared purpose defines Martian identity and produces a disciplined society, fundamentally different from Earth's overcrowded welfare state. Military service is compulsory, and the military-industrial complex forms the second pillar of the Martian economy alongside terraforming.

  # Government

  The government sits in Londres Nova, the capital city built beneath domes and tunnels in northern Aurorae Sinus. A Prime Minister leads the executive branch, elected by and answerable to the Martian Congress. The regime carries authoritarian tendencies beneath its parliamentary structure, with tight government control over economic planning and resource allocation.

  # Military

  The MCR maintains the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, a force smaller than the United Nations Navy but technologically superior. MCRN ships are faster and better armed than their Earth counterparts. The Donnager-class battleship, at nearly 500 meters, is the largest warship in the fleet. Stealth technology and advanced targeting systems give the MCRN a qualitative edge that compensates for Earth's numerical superiority.
