  Combined UNN + MCRN + OPA fleet. The UNN outnumbers the MCRN 5:1 in ships (canon, TV Season 2). The UNN operates Home Fleet, Jupiter Fleet, and Saturn Fleet with dreadnoughts, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and corvettes. 16 Leonidas-class battleships docked at Lovell City (Luna) during the Free Navy Conflict. Munroe-class light destroyers make up the larger portion of UNN fleets.

  The MCRN is smaller but fields more advanced ships. Exactly 8 Donnager-class battleships built during the Cold War. Morrigan-class patrol destroyers are mass-produced. Duarte later takes up to a third of the entire MCRN fleet to Laconia.

  Estimated: MCRN ~60 ships, UNN ~300 at 5:1 ratio, OPA ~10 converted civilian vessels. Total ~350.
