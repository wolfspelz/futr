readme: |
  Class 7 Interplanetary. Fusion-powered system colonization with habitats on planets, moons, and asteroids. 35 billion people across ~15 major settlements. No FTL, no interstellar ambitions at this snapshot. The Expanse's own scale rates humanity as Tier II (Interplanetary Civilization). High end of Class 7 due to mature multi-faction system presence, but no interstellar push keeps it below Class 8.
