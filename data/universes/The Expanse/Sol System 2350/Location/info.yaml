  All of humanity is confined to the Sol System. Settlements span from Earth and Luna in the inner system through Mars, the asteroid belt (Ceres, Eros, Vesta, Pallas), to the Jovian moons (Ganymede, Europa, Callisto, Io), Saturnian moons (Titan, Enceladus), and the small science station on Titania (Uranus). The outermost major presence is around Saturn.
