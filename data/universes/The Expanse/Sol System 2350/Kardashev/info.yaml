  Population: 35e9. Estimated per-person power: ~30,000 W (about 14x Earth 2023's 2,200 W/person). Fusion power is widespread via Epstein drives, but half of Earth's 30 billion live on Basic Assistance with modest energy footprints. Mars terraforming and Belt stations are energy-intensive.

  Total power: 35e9 x 30,000 = 1.05e15 W.
  Kardashev: log10(1.05e15) / 10 - 0.6 = 0.90.

  Min (10,000 W/person, conservative): 3.5e14 W, K = 0.85.
  Max (100,000 W/person, generous): 3.5e15 W, K = 0.95.

  No megastructures, no stellar energy harvesting. Approaching but not reaching Type I.
