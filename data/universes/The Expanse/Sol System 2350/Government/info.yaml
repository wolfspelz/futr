readme: |
  No unified Sol System government. Three competing entities share the system. The United Nations governs Earth and Luna as a federal presidential republic led by the Secretary-General. The Martian Congressional Republic is a parliamentary republic with compulsory military service, led by the Prime Minister. The Outer Planets Alliance is a decentralized movement of Belt factions, part political organization, part resistance network, not formally recognized as a sovereign entity by Earth or Mars.
