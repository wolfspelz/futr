  TL 7 Fusion. The Epstein drive is a modified deuterium-helium-3 fusion drive with magnetic coil exhaust acceleration. Hardest technology: controlled fusion for propulsion and power generation. Railguns and PDCs are electromagnetic/kinetic weapons, not a higher tech tier. No nanotech (TL 8), no FTL (TL 9), no artificial gravity, no energy shields.
