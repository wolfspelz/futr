  Class 7 Interplanetary. The MCR inhabits only one planet (Mars) but projects military power across the entire Sol System through three MCRN fleets. Fusion-powered Epstein drives enable sustained interplanetary operations. The MCR builds advanced warships, maintains stealth technology, and operates independently from Earth's industrial base. Single-planet settlement keeps it at the lower end of Class 7, but system-wide fleet reach and technological self-sufficiency place it firmly in this tier.
