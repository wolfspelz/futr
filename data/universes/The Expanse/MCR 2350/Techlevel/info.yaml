  TL 7 Fusion. The MCR's hardest technology is the Epstein drive: controlled deuterium-helium-3 fusion with magnetic coil exhaust acceleration. Weapons are electromagnetic (railguns) and kinetic (PDCs, torpedoes). The MCR leads in stealth composites and advanced ship design, but these are engineering refinements within the same fusion-era tech base as the rest of the Sol System. No nanotech (TL 8), no FTL (TL 9), no artificial gravity, no energy shields.
