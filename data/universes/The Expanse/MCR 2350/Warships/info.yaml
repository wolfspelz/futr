  Derived from the canon 5:1 UNN-to-MCRN ship ratio (TV Season 2). With the Sol System total estimated at 350 warships (UNN ~300, MCRN ~60, OPA ~10), the MCRN contributes approximately 60 combat vessels.

  Supporting evidence: exactly 8 Donnager-class battleships were built (canon). The Expanse Wiki lists 43 individually named MCRN ships across both books and TV. Admiral Duarte later defects with roughly a third of the fleet (~20 ships), consistent with a pre-defection total of ~60.

  The MCRN organizes its fleet into three commands: the Home Fleet (Mars and inner system), the Jupiter Fleet (Ceres to Ganymede), and the Saturn Fleet (outer system).
