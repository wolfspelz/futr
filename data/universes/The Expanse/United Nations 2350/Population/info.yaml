readme: |
  Earth's population is approximately thirty billion, stated in both the novels and the TV series. Luna adds roughly one hundred million (books) to one billion (TV). Over half of Earth's population lives on Basic Assistance, a welfare program providing food, housing, and minimal medical care but no employment.
