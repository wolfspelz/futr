  The UNN outnumbers the MCRN roughly five to one (canon, TV Season 2). With MCRN fleet strength estimated at ~60 warships, this gives ~300 UNN vessels. The fleet includes Truman-class dreadnoughts as battle group flagships, Xerxes-class battleships for close-range railgun engagements, Leonidas-class battleships as heavy troop carriers, and Munroe-class light destroyers as the mass-produced workhorse. Sixteen Leonidas-class alone are docked at Lovell City on Luna during the Free Navy Conflict.
