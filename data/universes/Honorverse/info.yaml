  David Weber's military science fiction universe, centered on the career of Honor Harrington.
  Set in the far future where humanity has spread across the galaxy using hyperspace travel
  and wormhole networks. The series draws parallels to the Age of Sail, with the Star Kingdom
  of Manticore echoing Imperial Britain and the People's Republic of Haven resembling
  Revolutionary/Napoleonic France. Features detailed space naval combat, political intrigue,
  and a richly developed interstellar civilization spanning thousands of worlds.
