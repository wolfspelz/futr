readme: |
  A constitutional monarchy founded in 1485 PD in the Manticore Binary System, located
  512 light-years north of Sol. Controls the strategically vital Manticore Wormhole Junction,
  a nexus of six wormhole termini connecting distant regions of human-settled space.
  This junction makes Manticore one of the wealthiest star nations in the galaxy despite
  its small population. Governed by the House of Winton through a bicameral Parliament
  with an elected House of Commons and hereditary House of Lords.
