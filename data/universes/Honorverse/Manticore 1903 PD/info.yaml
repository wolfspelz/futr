  The Star Kingdom of Manticore during the events of "The Honor of the Queen" (1903 PD),
  on the eve of war with the People's Republic of Haven. Captain Honor Harrington commands
  HMS Fearless on a diplomatic mission to Grayson, leading to the Treaty of Alliance between
  Manticore and the Protectorate of Grayson. This period marks Manticore's transition from
  peaceful trading power to wartime footing, as the expansionist People's Republic of Haven
  threatens the Manticoran Wormhole Junction.
