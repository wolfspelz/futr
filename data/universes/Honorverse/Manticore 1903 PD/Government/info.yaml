  The Star Kingdom operates as a constitutional monarchy established in 1485 PD
  when Roger Winton was crowned King Roger I. The government consists of:
  - The Monarch (House of Winton) as head of state with Royal Prerogative powers
  - A bicameral Parliament with House of Lords (upper) and House of Commons (lower)
  - A Prime Minister leading the government via parliamentary majority
  - The Royal Council (Cabinet) advising the Crown

  The Constitution requires heirs to the throne to marry commoners to maintain
  connection with the people.
