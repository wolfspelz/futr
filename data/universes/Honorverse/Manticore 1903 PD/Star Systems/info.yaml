readme: |
  By 1903 PD, the Star Kingdom of Manticore controlled two star systems:
  1. The Manticore Binary System (home system with three inhabited planets)
  2. The Basilisk System (annexed in 1865 PD to control the wormhole terminus)

  The Endicott System (Masada) came under military occupation during 1903 PD
  following the events of "Honor of the Queen," but was not yet formally incorporated.
