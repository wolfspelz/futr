  Estimated based on economic output relative to Sol System in 1900 PD:

  - Manticore's GSP was 78% of Sol's GSP (the highest in human space)
  - Manticore achieved this with ~3.2 billion people vs Sol's 10+ billion
  - Per-capita economic output approximately 2-3x Sol's
  - Technology includes interstellar travel, fusion power, and advanced industry

  Sol System in 1900 PD is an advanced interstellar hub, estimated at K~1.1-1.3.
  Manticore at 78% of that economic output with 1/3 the population indicates
  very high energy usage per capita.

  However, neither civilization harvests stellar-scale energy (not Type II),
  placing Manticore solidly in the Type I range at approximately K=1.1.
