  The Manticore Binary System contains three inhabited planets:
  - Manticore (capital world, Manticore-A III)
  - Sphinx (Manticore-A IV, homeworld of treecats)
  - Gryphon (Manticore-B IV, only habitable world in the B subsystem)
  All three were settled by the original colonists who arrived aboard the sublight
  colony ship Jason in 1416 PD.
