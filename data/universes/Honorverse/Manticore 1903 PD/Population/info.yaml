  Estimated total population across the three inhabited planets of the Manticore System
  (Manticore, Sphinx, Gryphon) plus asteroid belt populations. By 1922 PD the system
  had ~3.6 billion; by 1920 PD Sphinx had 1.2 billion and Gryphon had ~575 million
  (planet) plus 298 million in asteroid belts. Extrapolating backward to 1903 PD
  suggests approximately 3.2 billion total, with most residing in the Manticore-A subsystem.
