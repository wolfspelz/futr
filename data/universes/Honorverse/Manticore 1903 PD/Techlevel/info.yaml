  TL 9 FTL. Hyperspace FTL, impeller wedge drives (gravitics), grav-pulse communications.
  Hardest tech: impeller wedge — artificial gravity manipulation for propulsion and defense.
  No replicators, no transporters, no matter-energy conversion technology.
  Manticoran Wormhole Junction is a natural phenomenon, not built technology.
  Advanced missile tech (multi-drive missiles) but still kinetic/energy weapons.
