  TL 10 Matter Mastery. The Arkonides possess transmitter technology (Materietransmitter)
  of Lemurian origin, enabling instantaneous matter teleportation via hyperspace.
  Around 2040, transmitters are banned by imperial decree (Nardonn XX, due to Ferm disease),
  but the technology exists and the capability is proven. The ban is lifted in 2043 by Atlan.
  TL rates capability, not current policy. The Arkonides can build and operate transmitters.
  Robotregent is a giant positronic brain (TL 7) governing ~50,000 inhabited worlds.
  Transition drives (TL 9) and structural fields are secondary to transmitter tech.
