# Sample Civilization

A civilization is a fraction of a Universe. It may be the entire galaxy or just a single species in a certain year.

A civilization contains datapoints each with their own description. 

Each civilization is a folder with:
- descriptions: 
    - info.yaml
    - readme.md
- datapoints folders


The name of the folder becomes the name of the universe.

Write something about the civilization.

## info.yaml

```
date: {Year}
```

faction: {Faction name}

editors: {list of github handles, e.g. [wolfspelz]}
