  TL 10 Matter Mastery. Replicators, transporters, holographic matter (holodecks).
  Hardest tech: transporters, i.e. complete matter disassembly, quantum state transfer,
  and molecular-precision reassembly at a distance. Replicators convert energy to
  any desired matter configuration on demand. Both are matter-energy conversion
  well beyond simple FTL.
