    Assuming 100 billion people and an average of 100 kW power consumption per person which is a wild guess. 

    100 kW is 5-10 times early 21st century Earth, because "future".

    Disregarding the fact that the Federation is a post-scarcity society with ubiquitous replicators.

    If in fact these are universal assemblers then there must be some advanced tech that mitigates heat dissipation.
    And we do not hope they make the matter from energy. 
    In this case we would be off the scale because there would be not only megawatts of molecular bond recombination energies but also nuclear war like energies in every private kitchen. 

    Also warp drive might take a lot of energy not counted here.
