  A constitutional monarchy of blue-skinned, antenna-bearing humanoids from the
  icy moon Andoria in the Procyon system. Known for their militaristic culture
  centered on honor, the Andorian Imperial Guard, and the Ushaan ritual combat.

  Andorians achieved warp capability around 1154 AD, making them one of the
  oldest warp-capable civilizations in the Alpha Quadrant. They had a centuries-long
  territorial conflict with the Vulcans before finding common cause with Earth
  during the 22nd century.

  One of the four founding members of the United Federation of Planets in 2161,
  alongside Earth, Vulcan, and Tellar Prime.
