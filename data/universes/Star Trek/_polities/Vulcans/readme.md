# Vulcans

The Vulcans are a humanoid species from the planet Vulcan. They have pointed ears and copper-based green blood.

Vulcan society is built on the principle of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations). After a violent past, the Vulcans adopted a philosophy of strict logic and emotional suppression. Children are trained from a young age to control their emotions. Despite appearances, Vulcans do have emotions; they simply choose not to act on them.

One of their notable abilities is the mind meld, which allows a Vulcan to merge consciousness with another being, sharing thoughts, memories, and experiences.
