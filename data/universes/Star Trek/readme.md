The Star Trek universe follows various starship crews as they navigate interstellar diplomacy, discovery, and conflict in a future where humanity belongs to a larger galactic community. The Federation operates on the principle that cooperation between species beats conquest, though this conviction gets tested regularly by Klingons, Romulans, the Borg, and the Dominion. The setting spans from the 22nd century (Enterprise) through the 24th (TNG, DS9, Voyager) and into the 32nd century (Discovery).
