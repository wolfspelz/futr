  According to the non-canon reference book "Star Trek Star Charts" (2002),
  the Andorians achieved warp capability in 1154 AD (Earth calendar).

  This makes them one of the oldest warp-capable civilizations in the Alpha
  Quadrant, predating humans by approximately 900 years (Earth achieved warp
  in 2063). For comparison: Vulcans achieved warp ~320 AD, Klingons ~930 AD.
