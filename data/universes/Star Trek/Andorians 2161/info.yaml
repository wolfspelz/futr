  The Andorian Empire at the founding of the United Federation of Planets.

  After the Earth-Romulan War (2156-2160), the Andorians joined Earth, Vulcan,
  and Tellar as founding members of the Federation on August 12, 2161 in
  San Francisco. Commander Thy'lek Shran of the Imperial Guard and Captain
  Jonathan Archer of Enterprise NX-01 were instrumental in forging the alliance.

  At this time, the Andorian Empire consisted of their homeworld (the icy moon
  Andoria) and approximately 13 colonies. The Imperial Guard operated Kumari-class
  battle cruisers capable of speeds exceeding warp 5.
