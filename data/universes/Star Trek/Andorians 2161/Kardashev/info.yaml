  Estimated Kardashev level for a warp-capable civilization with ~1000 years of
  FTL travel history. The Andorians achieved warp in ~1154 AD and by 2161 had
  14 inhabited worlds with Kumari-class ships exceeding warp 5.

  For comparison: Earth 2023 (single planet, no FTL) = K0.73. Federation 2373
  (150 worlds, replicators) = K1.0. The Andorians fall between these as an
  established interstellar civilization approaching Type I status.
