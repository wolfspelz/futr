  The Andorian Empire is a constitutional monarchy established in the 19th century
  when Thalisar the Last unified the warring clans. She deliberately died childless
  and created the parliamentary democracy that has governed Andoria since.

  The position of head of state is symbolically empty, represented by the Empty
  Throne in the Parliament Andoria Complex. The head of government is the
  Chancellor (or Presider), determined by the majority party in Parliament.
