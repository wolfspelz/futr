readme: |
  No canon population figure exists. Non-canon sources cite ranges of 5-11 billion.
  Federation Space Wiki states Andoria alone has 5 billion Andorians.
  Memory Beta references 11 billion at the empire's height across all colonies.
  8 billion is used as a reasonable midpoint estimate for 2161.
