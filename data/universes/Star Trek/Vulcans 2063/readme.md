# Vulcans around the Year 2063 (First Contact)

In 2063, Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight in the Phoenix attracts a passing Vulcan survey ship. The Vulcans land in Bozeman, Montana, making this the first official contact between humans and an alien species. Earth is still recovering from the Third World War, and the Vulcans take on an advisory role, helping humanity rebuild over the following decades. From the Vulcan perspective, humans are a volatile but promising species worth monitoring.
