  Contact units (primarily GCUs) serving as the Culture's de facto military before purpose-built warships were developed during the Idiran War. The "million or so" GCU figure comes from The State of the Art, set approximately 650 years after the war. The pre-war count is estimated at a similar order of magnitude. Before 1289 CE, the Culture had no dedicated warships at all.
