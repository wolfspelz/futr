  14,334 Orbitals were destroyed during the Idiran-Culture War (Consider Phlebas appendix, total all sides). Approximately half are estimated as Culture Orbitals (~7,000). Assuming a 50% destruction rate, the pre-war Culture total is approximately 14,000. Each Orbital is a ring-shaped megastructure approximately 3 million km in diameter with a habitable surface area 20 times that of Earth.
