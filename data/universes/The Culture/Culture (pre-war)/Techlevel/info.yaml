  Techlevel 13 (Spacetime Mastery). The Culture's most advanced technologies include gridfire (forcing the Energy Grid to intersect with realspace), void-like reactionless propulsion, effector-based metric manipulation, and hyperspace computation by Minds. These place it in the spacetime mastery tier, beyond wormhole engineering but short of pocket universe creation.
