readme: |
  No canon population figure exists. Lore states Orks are the most numerous sapient species in the
  galaxy, outnumbering even humanity. The Imperium of Man has roughly quadrillions of humans across
  about one million worlds. Fan estimates for Orks range from tens of quadrillions to quintillions,
  based on the number of Ork-inhabited worlds (more than the Imperium's million) and estimated
  populations per world. The extreme uncertainty reflects the lore's deliberate vagueness and the
  boom-bust nature of Ork populations driven by WAAAGH! cycles.
