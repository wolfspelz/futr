  Ork society is governed by a simple principle: might makes right. The biggest, strongest Ork leads
  as Warboss. Society is organized into mobs, warbands, and tribes, with no central government.
  Occasionally a powerful Warboss unites multiple tribes into a Waaagh!, a combined migration and
  holy war, but these coalitions dissolve when the leader is killed. The system is a kratocracy
  (rule by the strong) organized along tribal lines.
