readme: |
  No canon number of Ork-controlled worlds exists. The lore states Orks inhabit more worlds than the
  Imperium of Man, which controls approximately one million planets. Ork territory is fragmented
  across thousands of independent empires, warbands, and feral Ork worlds. The estimate of 2 million
  accounts for the stated superiority over Imperial territory plus the many feral Ork worlds that
  persist on planets where Orks have ever fought, since their fungal spores are nearly impossible to
  fully eradicate.
