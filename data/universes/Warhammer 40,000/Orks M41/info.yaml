  The Orks in the 41st Millennium are the most numerous sapient species in the galaxy, scattered
  across thousands of independent empires and warbands. They control more worlds than even the
  Imperium of Man. This era sees the rise of Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, the most powerful Warboss
  since The Beast, who launched two massive invasions of Armageddon and is uniting Ork tribes across
  the galaxy in the Great Waaagh!.
