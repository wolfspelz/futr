  The Imperium of Man is the galaxy-spanning interstellar empire ruled by the immortal
  God-Emperor of Mankind from the Golden Throne on Terra. Founded during the Great Crusade
  in the 30th Millennium, the Imperium is the largest and most powerful human civilization
  in history, encompassing approximately one million worlds across the Milky Way galaxy.

  The Imperium is a theocratic totalitarian state, nominally ruled by the Emperor but
  actually governed by the High Lords of Terra and the vast bureaucracy of the Adeptus Terra.
  It exists in a state of perpetual war against alien species, Chaos, and internal heresy.
