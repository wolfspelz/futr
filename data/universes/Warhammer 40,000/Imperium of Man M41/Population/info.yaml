  The total human population of the Imperium is estimated at 10-20 quadrillion (1-2 × 10^16).

  The population is extremely unevenly distributed:
  - ~32,000 Hive Worlds with 50 billion to 2 trillion inhabitants each (~8 × 10^15 total)
  - ~968,000 other worlds (agri-worlds, feudal worlds, forge worlds, etc.) with much smaller populations

  The Administratum does not maintain accurate census data across the entire Imperium due to
  its vast scale and bureaucratic inefficiency. These figures are estimates based on known
  hive world populations and extrapolation.
