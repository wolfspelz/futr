  The Imperium is canonically described as ruling "a million worlds" across approximately
  two-thirds of the Milky Way galaxy. This figure is repeatedly stated in official sources.

  World types include:
  - Hive Worlds (~32,000): Dense population centers
  - Forge Worlds: Industrial/manufacturing centers of the Adeptus Mechanicus
  - Agri-Worlds: Agricultural production
  - Civilised Worlds: Standard human settlements
  - Feudal/Feral Worlds: Low-technology planets
  - Death Worlds: Extremely hostile environments
  - Shrine Worlds: Religious significance

  The actual number fluctuates as worlds are lost to war, rediscovered, or founded.
