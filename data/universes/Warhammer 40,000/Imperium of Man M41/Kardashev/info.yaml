  Calculated assuming approximately 1 MW average energy consumption per person, accounting
  for personal use, industrial output, void ship operations, and military expenditure.

  Calculation:
  - Population: 1.5 × 10^16
  - Per capita energy: 1 × 10^6 W (1 MW)
  - Total power: 1.5 × 10^22 W
  - Kardashev: K = (log₁₀(1.5 × 10^22) - 6) / 10 = 1.62

  The Imperium does NOT harness stellar output directly (no Dyson spheres), placing it
  below a true Type II civilization. However, its massive industrial base across a million
  worlds, enormous military apparatus, and warp-capable fleet represent significant energy
  output well beyond planetary scale. The Imperium at 1 MW
  per capita represents ~430× Earth's current per-capita energy consumption.
