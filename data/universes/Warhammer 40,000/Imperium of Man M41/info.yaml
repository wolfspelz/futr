  The Imperium of Man at the end of the 41st Millennium (circa 999.M41), representing the
  classic "grimdark" setting of Warhammer 40,000. The God-Emperor has been interred on the
  Golden Throne for over 10,000 years, kept alive only by the daily sacrifice of thousands
  of psykers. The High Lords of Terra rule in His name while the Imperium faces existential
  threats from all sides: the forces of Chaos, Ork WAAAGH!s, Tyranid hive fleets, Necron
  awakening, and countless other xenos species.

  This era represents the Imperium at its most desperate—technologically stagnant, spiritually
  fanatical, and stretched impossibly thin across a million worlds. The Astronomican still
  shines, but the Time of Ending approaches.
