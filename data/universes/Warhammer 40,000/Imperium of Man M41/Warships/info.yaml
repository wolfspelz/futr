  The Imperial Navy (Navis Imperialis) operates hundreds of thousands of warships across
  the galaxy. Exact numbers are deliberately vague in lore, with estimates ranging from
  250,000 to over 1 million vessels of all classes.

  Fleet composition by ship class:
  - Battleships: 6-8 km length, billions of tons displacement
  - Grand Cruisers: Large capital ships
  - Cruisers: 5-6 km length, form the backbone of most fleets
  - Escorts: 0.75-3 km length (frigates, destroyers)

  The average sector fleet comprises 50-75 vessels. With roughly 10,000 sectors in the
  Imperium, this implies a minimum of 500,000-750,000 warships.

  This count excludes:
  - Adeptus Mechanicus vessels
  - Space Marine Chapter fleets
  - Inquisitorial vessels
  - Rogue Trader ships
  - Civilian/merchant fleet
