  The Imperium is nominally an absolute theocratic monarchy with the God-Emperor as supreme
  ruler. In practice, since the Emperor's internment on the Golden Throne after the Horus
  Heresy, it functions as a theocratic oligarchy.

  Governing structure:
  - The Emperor: Nominally supreme, but interred and unable to communicate directly
  - Senatorum Imperialis: The 12 High Lords of Terra who rule in the Emperor's name
  - Adeptus Terra: The vast bureaucratic priesthood that administers the Imperium
  - Ecclesiarchy: The state religion (Imperial Cult) worshipping the Emperor as a god

  Key institutions outside direct Adeptus Terra control:
  - Adeptus Mechanicus: Semi-autonomous tech-priests with their own religious hierarchy
  - Inquisition: Independent authority to act in the Emperor's name
  - Adeptus Astartes: Space Marine Chapters with significant autonomy
