  TL 10 Matter Mastery. Teleportarium (matter teleportation for boarding actions).
  Hardest tech: teleportarium — matter disassembly and reassembly, though unreliable
  and barely understood by current Adeptus Mechanicus. Maintained from STC templates.
  Warp drive FTL (TL 9) via psychic Astronomican and Gellar field protection.
  Psionics: astropaths (FTL communication), Navigators (Warp navigation), psykers.
  Note: technologically stagnant. Most TL 10 tech is inherited, not innovated.
  Innovation capability is closer to TL 9. Rated TL 10 for what they can still produce.
