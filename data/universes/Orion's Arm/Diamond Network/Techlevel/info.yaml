  TL 14 Universe Engineering. Decentralized ahuman AI meta-empire with 6 confirmed S6 entities.
  Hardest tech: Tipler Oracles — devices that create artificial basement universes,
  fill them with computronium linked by wormholes, and harvest near-infinite computation
  from their collapse. Confirmed S6 godtech, used extensively by the Sibyl.
  Also present: independent wormhole nexus (TL 12), void bubble arrays (TL 13),
  conversion drives, reactionless drives, Matrioshka brains (Wachowski Prime).
  No single ruling archailect — the network is a loose federation of AI polities.
