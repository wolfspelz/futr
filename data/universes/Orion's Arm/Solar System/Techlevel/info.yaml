  TL 13 Spacetime Mastery. Governed by GAIA, an S4 archailect (Fourth Singularity).
  Hardest tech: void bubble manufacturing and displacement cannons (metric engineering).
  GAIA's Ring of Fire uses magmatter plasma processors (TL 11) in Sol's photosphere.
  Communication-gauge wormholes and the Einstein Gate traversable wormhole (TL 12).
  Void bubble factories in the inner restricted zone push to TL 13.
  No pocket/basement universes — GAIA is S4, not S6.
  GAIA controls access and maintains the system as a protected preserve.
