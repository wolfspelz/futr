  TL 14 Universe Engineering. 34 confirmed S6 Greatest Archailects (13 Sephirotic + 21 others).
  Hardest tech: basement universe creation. S6 archailects extend their existence into
  metric constructions of their own creation. Scholars believe most S6 entities use them.
  Also present: void ships and void swarms (TL 13), wormhole nexus spanning ~10M systems (TL 12),
  metric bombs, thunderbolts, implosion weapons, magmatter (TL 11).
  The average modosophont citizen uses TL 8 (nanotech) level technology.
  S7 is theoretical/unconfirmed. S6 is the confirmed maximum toposophic level.
