  TL 6 Atomic. Advanced computing, LLM AI, nuclear power, ISS, CRISPR.
  Hardest tech: still nuclear fission and semiconductor electronics.
  No controlled fusion yet (ITER incomplete). AI is narrow, not general.
  Same fundamental TL as the 1980s, but more refined, not a new tech level.
  
  As they say: "The 2020s are the new 1980s, but with more AI and less disco."

  1920: The first Atlantic crossing by plane, a biplane with propellers. 
  Commercial radio just started broadcasting. 
  Nuclear Power is not even thought of. 

  1970: Nuclear power stations are common. Broadcast color TV is the norm. 
  The Jumbo jet takes commercial air travel to a new level and humans have just landed on the moon. 

  2020: Still nuclear fission. Color TVs are now flat. 
  The Jumbo Jet is still the largest commercial airplane and humanity is not able to land on the moon but is determined to regain the capability in a few years. 
  There are smart phones and ubiquitous information, though.
  The media and information landscape changed beyond imagination.
  Rockets are now reusable.
  Electrical light is basically free thanks to LEDs.
  Cars are more efficient needing only half as much gas. Yet, they are twice as big, effectively consuming as much fuel.
  And the tallest building is twice as high. 
  Everyday life looks like an improved 1970 with smartphones.
